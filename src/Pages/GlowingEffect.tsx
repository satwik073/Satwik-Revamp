            Still 5/5 for me. Good job.</div>
            <div className=" w-full  bg-white mb-8 p-[30px] rounded-[1rem] text-[16px] ">I've been searched for a long time for a suitable framework because that's what you can call this Theme, and my choice fell on the above that one. I'm 100% satisfied after a month of implementation, on top of that VERY helpful support.
            As something between us only, but I would pay and 10x for so much in the package. Very well spent every $ dollar.</div>

And if there is a problem, the team is always helpful when asking questions via comments or support.</div>

What stands out even more is the excellent customer support they provide. They have been responsive and helpful whenever I have had questions or needed assistance. It's been a great experience overall!</div>
            <div className=" w-full  bg-white mb-8 p-[30px] rounded-[1rem] text-[16px] ">I have purchased many other themes that claim 90+ page speed, but after I have designed the website, and added all possible optimizations, very few actually achieve similar speed. Ohio theme is one of those that achieved 90+ speed after all needed changes. Easy customization, many good options and features, highly recommended.</div>
